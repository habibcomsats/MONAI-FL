This folder will contains an FL api to interface with all components in the backend as well as frontend.  

We are open to developers who can contribute in this direction.  

Our ultimate goal is to design a neat and clean IDE for FL development in healthcare applications.

We welcome every idea to improve the platform.

Please feel free to contribute in this module. 

If you have any front-end related idea and you want to contribute into the ecosystem, please feel free to generate a pull request 

or send a message at federatedlearningresearch@gmail.com

If you find any issue in the code, please see the FAQ section or open an issue for the community.

Happy Coding!!!
