## This folder will contains all communication related code. 

Currently we have added client-server communication model over naked sockets in order to make 
it usable over any communication network (standalond, LAN, WLAN, WAN, etc.)

Our goal is to design an open system with less dependencies over underlying network.

We welcome every idea to improve the platform.
