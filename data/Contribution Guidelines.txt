This folder will contains all related datasets for experimentation.  

We are looking to add more datasets. 

Our goal is to design an open experimental data platform to cater various types of medical intelligence applications.

We welcome every idea to improve the platform.

Please feel free to contribute in this module. 

If you have any healthcare related dataset and you want to add into the system, please feel free to generate a pull request or send a message

If you find any issue in the code, please see the FAQ section or open an issue for the community.

Happy Coding!!!
