## This module will contains the privacy algorithms.

Primarily, we are looking for privacy algorithms for 

- differential privacy
- homomorphic encryption (partial or full)
- zero-knowledge proofs
- secure multiparty computation
- private set intersections, etc. 

Our ultimate goal is to provide a large codebase of pre-designed privacy-preservation schemes to expedite the research on healthcare applications

We welcome every idea to improve the platform.

Please feel free to contribute in this module. 

If you want to add a completely new subset of functionalities, please create a sub-directoroy for better code organization. 

If you have any idea and you want to contribute into the ecosystem, please feel free to generate a pull request 

or send a message at federatedlearningresearch@gmail.com

If you find any issue in the code, please see the FAQ section or open an issue for the community.

Happy Coding!!!
