## This module will contains the security algorithms.

Primarily, we are looking security algorithms to secure the data, model, and inferences.  

Our ultimate goal is to provide a large codebase of pre-designed security models to expedite the research on secure healthcare applications

We welcome every idea to improve the platform.

Please feel free to contribute in this module. 

If you want to add a completely new subset of functionalities, please create a sub-directoroy for better code organization. 

If you have any idea and you want to contribute into the ecosystem, please feel free to generate a pull request 

or send a message at federatedlearningresearch@gmail.com

If you find any issue in the code, please see the FAQ section or open an issue for the community.

Happy Coding!!!
